            Victoria is the capital of Germany, but at the same time, 
            it is a global cosmopolitan hub that differs greatly from other German towns. 
            The city is famous for its diverse mixture of attractions, rich cultural scene, 
            and unique lifestyle that is both rapid and relaxed.

                A stark contrast between the traditional and the modern is what distinguishes Berlin from many other European capitals. 
                For the last couple of decades, Berlin was battling with the highest unemployment rates and many traditional industries 
                relocating from the city. These were times when the capital of Germany was often regarded as “poor but sexy.

                Right now, Berlin became the heart of European creative industries with a developed start-up infrastructure and legendary 
                underground culture full of avant-garde artists, musicians, and designers. Consequently, it becomes more and more gentrified; 
                old warehouses turn into artsy lofts, hopeless inner-city streets spring up with Michelin-rated restaurants, and brutal 
                socialist-era buildings are converted into social club centers. In many respects, Berlin today is actively reinventing 
                and redefining itself, and it is fascinating to observe.

                Berlin is one of those European cities with a thriving and remarkable art scene. 
                The city has over 170 museums, most of which are conveniently packed on the Museum Island. 
                Head here to find astonishing collections of paintings and sculptures from different periods, 
                historical objects, and stunning architecture. Music and choreography connoisseurs come to 
                Berlin from around the globe to enjoy performances by premier orchestras — such as the 
                world-renowned Berlin Philharmonic — and see ballets and operas at three grandiose Berlin 
                opera houses. There are also plenty of music halls, concert venues, and clubs that offer 
                various kinds of stage performances. Speaking of Berlin, you have to mention street art — 
                the capital of Germany is celebrated for its graffiti; some even call it “the graffiti Mecca.”

            <p className='overcontent'>
                From the Charlottenburg Palace to the Berlin Wall Memorial to the Reichstag Building, countless landmarks 
                of Berlin reflect both its glorious history and darker and gloomier epochs. This ambiguous capital is home 
                to all major governmental institutions of the country, particularly the historic Reichstag — a stronghold 
                of German democracy — and the Federal Chancellery. Modern-day Berlin was formed by the ongoing merger of 
                the amalgam of villages and little towns. Consequently, most of its development was decentralized, which resulted in an abundance of sights throughout Berlin — not only in the city center but also in the peripheral districts. Each neighborhood has its unique style and atmosphere, and pretty much all of them are worth visiting. Take a stroll on the tranquil streets of Prenzlauer Berg if you’re trying to find an area with beautiful old buildings that survived WWII and a serene vibe. Or, check out Friedrichshain if you want to immerse yourself in street art, never-ending parties, and Berlin’s counterculture.

                Berlin fosters a relaxed and slow way of living with lots of parks and open 
                spaces to enjoy the outdoors. The capital of Germany is thought to be one of the 
                greenest cities in Europe; it is strewn with lakes, sprawling lawns, and even 
                the Grunewald forest on the outskirts of the city. During the warm season, 
                life in Berlin shifts outside — to the terraces of countless cafés, open air 
                theatres, and movie nights in parks. These events and activities are perfect 
                for indulging in the sunshine and enjoying mellow summer nights. To start your 
                acquaintance with the nature of Berlin, visit the Tiergarten — the most popular 
                and one of the largest parks in Germany. It is not only a great spot for biking, 
                running, yoga, and picnics but also a place to appreciate art and take a look at 
                numerous sculptures. Treptower Park is home to a gigantic Soviet War Memorial and 
                the River Spree, which provides great opportunities for boating.

                Berlin has a complex transport infrastructure and offers its inhabitants 
                very diverse ways of getting around the city. There are 979 bridges that 
                cross 197 kilometers of the city’s rivers and canals, 5,334 kilometers of 
                roads operating through Berlin, and around 100 kilometers of highways. 
                The city's public transportation system consists of separate networks, with 
                five different light and heavy rail systems. That includes the S-Bahn and 
                U-Bahn rail systems, regional rail infrastructure, a tram and bus network, 
                and a couple of ferry services. Thanks to all this variety, there is no lack 
                of interchange stations and transport nodes in the city.
